# OSMS-OKHs: A Searchable Registry for Open-Source Projects
This is a repository that will hold a wide range of open-source projects from the non-profit Open Source Medical Supplies (OSMS). The data from these projects will move into an OpenKnowHow (OKH) format in JSON from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/iop-alliance/OpenKnowHow/blob/master/res/sample_data/okh-TEMPLATE.toml). Once in this state, a LOSH-krawler can find these projects after a user searchers for them. Ultimately, these files will allow users to easily discover important humanitarian projects for personal use, or as a pathway to become more involved in humanitarian engineering.

## Process and Timeline (Updated Alongside Progress)
**December 2024**
Members of the project team discussed the OKH formatting and exceptions to accomodate the varied data available for each project. Moved several project datasets from the .json OSH-Registry under Public Invention to the OKH repository. 

## Important notes:
  * These are .toml files. If interested in learning more, check out this link:[TOML](https://toml.io/en/)
  * This project is in partnership with both [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/volunteer/) and [OSMS](https://opensourcemedicalsupplies.org/). Check out their websites if you would like to get involved in similar projects.
  * Not all of the projects listed in the files were created by Public Invention or OSMS. If interested in building one, please see the licenser contact information.
